# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We maintain the most recent `main` branch. Report issues against the latest commit or tagged release.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. Do **not** create a public GitHub issue.
2. Open a private security advisory on GitHub or email the repository owner at the address listed on their GitHub profile.
3. Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, affected modules, potential impact).
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure.

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
